# Website Freight KFC - Development Scratchpad

## Project Overview
- Framework: Remix
- UI Components: Radix UI and shadcn
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## Current Status (2025-01-14)

### Completed
- Basic project setup with Remix framework
- Added essential UI components from Radix UI
- Created main layout components (Header, Footer)
- Set up basic routing structure
- Converted Header and Footer to use Remix conventions
- Updated root layout with proper Remix structure

### Current Issues
1. React Server Components Issue
   - Current error with React elements in loader data
   - Need to move icon components to client-side rendering
   - Refactor data structure to avoid passing React elements through loader

2. Framework Migration
   - Continuing to update components to Remix patterns
   - Need to ensure proper server/client separation
   - Review data loading patterns

### Next Steps
1. Fix Server Component Issue
   - Refactor index page loader to only pass static data
   - Move icon rendering to component level
   - Implement proper data serialization

2. Component Enhancement
   - Add proper error boundaries
   - Implement loading states
   - Add meta tags for SEO
   - Implement proper client-side navigation

3. Feature Implementation
   - Complete services section with proper routing
   - Add contact form functionality
   - Implement pricing page
   - Add authentication flow

4. Testing & Optimization
   - Add end-to-end tests
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Optimize asset loading
   - Add proper caching strategies

## Layout Structure Update (2025-01-22)

### Issue
Duplicate header and footer components were present in both `root.tsx` and `routes/_app.tsx`, causing potential conflicts and unnecessary rendering.

### Changes Made

1. **app/root.tsx**
   - Moved the complete layout structure to root.tsx
   - Added meta function for global SEO settings
   - Integrated Header and Footer components
   - Added main content wrapper with flex-1 for proper layout
   - Consolidated all global layout elements in one place

2. **app/routes/_app.tsx**
   - Simplified to only handle the Outlet component
   - Removed duplicate Header and Footer
   - Removed redundant meta function
   - Cleaned up unnecessary imports

### Benefits
- Single source of truth for layout structure
- Cleaner routing hierarchy
- Better performance (no duplicate components)
- More maintainable codebase
- Proper SEO meta tags handling at root level

### Layout Structure
```
root.tsx
├── Header
├── main
│   └── _app.tsx
│       └── [other routes]
└── Footer
```

This structure ensures that the Header and Footer are rendered only once and properly positioned in the application hierarchy.

## Notes
- Keep track of any server/client separation issues
- Review Remix documentation for proper data loading patterns
- Consider implementing proper form validation
- Plan for proper error boundary implementation
